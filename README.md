# LoRa
This repo serve the purpose of:

* Create an omnet++ model of the LoRa exchanges
* Create a new exchange in Lora
* Make simulation campaigns on this one
* Create an analysis on the results
* Implements the algorithms into LoPy sensors, Semtech sensors etc..

At the moment in Omnet:
Only 3 cSimpleModule implemented :
* An Isolated Node
* A LoRa Gateway
* A LoRaWAN Gateway

At the moment in Python LoPy:
Only 3 cSimpleModule implemented :
* An Isolated Node
* A LoRa Gateway
* A LoRaWAN Gateway

To do List :

1. Add multi-frequency/channels features
2. Create LoRaGateway module for LoPy sensors
3. Create LoRaWANGateway module for LoPy sensors
4. Make real tests.
